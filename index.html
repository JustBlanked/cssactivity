    <h1>Passive: Contempt for the weak</h1>
    <p>Zed's passive which only procs when you have HP advantage. Can be used to style on opponents after a finishing combo.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="skill-desc">
    <img class="moveset" src="img\zed-q.gif" alt="passive-gif">
    <h1>Q/1st Skill: Razor Shuriken</h1>
    <p>Zed's Q is the go to damage skill in his own kit. Only Zed's Q when your confidence is very boosted. The Q has a pre-requisite of 5000+ hours of champion usage before the skill hits.
    It can go through minions and other champions but damage decreases by a lot.</p>

    <img class="moveset" src="img\zed-w.gif" alt="passive-gif">
    <h1>W/2nd Skill: Living Shadow</h1>
    <p>Zed's W, the living shadow, throws a shadow to a short distance and mimics the champion's E and Q skill. W can go through short walls. The skills is used to 5head-bigbrain-anklebreak the enemy in the worst possible way because
    zed teleports in the when the skill is pressed. It can only be used once and this skill requires 200 IQ to make good plays.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="skill-desc">
    <img class="moveset" src="img\zed-e.gif" alt="passive-gif">
    <h1>E/3rd Skill: Shadow Slash</h1>
  <p>When Zed's third skill is casted, the surrounding enemies in a small radius will be damaged. If the skill is mimiced by the living shadow, it will slow down the enemies movement a little
  and if Zed hits an enemy with the skill, the cooldown for the second skill is reduced by 1 second depending on the enemy champions hit. The skill is used for dueling melee champs. When the skill
does not hit, it will reduce the user's IQ by 10.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="skill-desc">
    <img class="moveset" src="img\zed-r.gif" alt="passive-gif">
    <h1>R/Ultimate Skill: Death Mark</h1>
  <p>Zed's ultimate skill will allow him to instantly disappear and mark the enemy for 1.5 seconds. After marking, Zed will appear behind the enemy, making him very predictable. After being marked
  ,the user must spam and hit every ability within 3.5 seconds so that Zed will be able to deal damage to the enemy before the mark bursts. Zed's ultimate can be used to ultimately big-brain the opponent, it can be used to dodge every skill shot in the game
and it is the only skill where you can BM your opponent.</p>
